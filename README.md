## About Stackbit

[Stackbit](https://www.stackbit.com/) enables features like inline content editing, live previews and collaboration tools for Jamstack sites.

## Working with This Theme

This theme is written in [Unibit](https://docs.stackbit.com/unibit/). Themes written in Unibit can be converted to other static sites generators (SSG) such as Gatsby, Hugo, Jekyll and Next.js using [Stackbit Site Builder](https://app.stackbit.com/create?theme=https://github.com/stackbithq/stackbit-theme-azimuth). The site builder will generate the SSG-specific version of this theme and push it to your own GitHub repository. You are free to use and modify the generated source however you wish.

### Editing This Theme

While we recommend using the [site builder](https://app.stackbit.com/create?theme=https://github.com/stackbithq/stackbit-theme-azimuth) to generate an SSG-specific version of this theme, you can develop this theme locally using the Unibit CLI. For details on how to install and use Unibit, visit the [unibit documentation](https://docs.stackbit.com/site-builder/unibit/).

### Develop Using CodeSandbox

You can also develop this theme in the browser using Unibit via CodeSandbox.
